Description
This project explores a unique approach to encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation techniques. Instead of traditional methods like substitution or transposition, we leverage the properties of images to encode and decode messages.

Features
Encryption: Encode plaintext messages into an image by manipulating pixel values.
Decryption: Retrieve the original message from the encoded image through pixel analysis.

Encryption:

Provide a plaintext message and an image to embed the message into.
Manipulate the pixel values of the image based on the message content.
Generate an encoded image with the hidden message.

Decryption:

Input the encoded image.
Analyze the pixel values to extract the hidden message.
Retrieve the original plaintext message.
